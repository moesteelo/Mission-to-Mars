# Mission-to-Mars
In this project, I am using HTML Web scraping on Mars data to create a Flask web application usig MongoDB, Python, & CSS

## Overview
Mission to Mars is a project that uses HTML Webscraping in a python script that scarpes the latest Mars information and images through varipus websites. In doing this project I created a interesting Flask web appication that protrayed an HTML template designed using Bootscrap to display all the data in a web location without having to manually gather information various websites. The data was scraped and stored in a Mongo database that stored the data and than was displayed in the Flask web application. Futhermore, I was able to connect the scrapig script so that each time the "Scrape New Data" button was clicked, I would recieve the latest infomation regarding Mars. Lastly, by using the Bootstrap's grid system I was able to create a web app that displayed Mars latest information on any device people view it from.

The final product was a fully-functional Flask web application created that inlcudes images, a fact table with information comparing Mars and Earth, and the latest articles and a short description scarped from NASA's website. With the "Scrape New Data" button we can rest assured that every time we click this button, we will always have the lastest information regarding Mars and it's future. :telescope:
